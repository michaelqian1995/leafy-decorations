# Leafy decorations

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Export the required graphics from the downloaded assets, compress & smush them. **The artboards in Illustrator are already the correct dimensions—don’t change their width or height.**
- Use background images, borders, colours & linear-gradients to create the design.
- There is a `linear-gradient` in the design, you’ll have to figure out where it is and how it works.
- Some of the CSS is already done for you.
- **DO NOT change the HTML file.**
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Needed CSS properties

These are the only CSS properties you’ll need to add to accomplish the layout:

- `background` or if you prefer: `background-image`, `background-position`, `background-size`, `background-repeat`, `background-color`
- `border` and the individual sides: `border-top`, etc.
- `border-radius`
- `color`
- `padding-top` — in only one place
